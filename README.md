## Approach
The first thing we did after beginning was to establish a comfortable dynamic between all members of the team. We spent a fair amount of time establishing expectations, ambitions and concerns for our week working together.
We continued by converting the headline specifications into user stories, as well as thinking of the more basic functionality (relative to the headline specifications) that needed to be in our project. They were also converted into user stories and can be viewed below. After that was done, we domain modelled the project (you can view the diagram below).

Once we exited the planning stage we split the project into small tasks and worked in pairs with one member being left alone at any one time. To compensate for the less than ideal nature of somebody being a solo artist, we switched stations (tasks and pairs) quite often. This benefitted all of us by giving us variety in the material we were working on and learning/consolidating, as well as giving us a chance to work with all other members of the team and experience the subtle differences in their work preferences. We would reconvene frequently and briefly to assess our progress and allocate new tasks based on prerequisites being met or issues arising from prior changes. The most important thing we did was to remain flexible and versatile in our approach, ready for any blocker that came our way.

### User Stories
  ```
  As a user
  So that I can look for holiday apartments
  I want to be able to view a list of spaces
  ```
  ```
  As a user
  So that I can find a perfect holiday apartment
  I want to be able to view every space in detail with a title, description, image and price.
  ```
  ```
  As a user
  So that I can go on a holiday
  I want to be able to book an apartment I want.
  ```
  ```
  As a user
  So that my details are saved
  I want to be able to sign up
  ```
  ```
  As a user
  So that only I can access my account
  I want to be able to sign in or sign out.
  ```
### Minimum Viable Product
Our MVP consists of the first two user stories in the above list, namely being able to see a list of spaces and being able to view any one space in more detail.

### Next Steps
We will add the functionality to book a space, which will make use of the User class. The functionality for a user to sign up (and requirement when attempting to book a space) will also be added, along with signing in and out.
